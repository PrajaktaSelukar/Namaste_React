# 1. Props (like arguments to a function)
In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.

# 2. Config driven UI
User interface (UI) of an application is primarily defined and controlled by configuration rather than hard-coded implementation. This allows for greater flexibility, ease of customization, and dynamic changes to the UI without requiring extensive code modifications.
